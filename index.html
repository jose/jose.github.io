<p>José Campos is a Assistant Professor at the University of Lisbon (Portugal).
He completed his Ph.D. at the University of Sheffield (UK) under the supervision
of Gordon Fraser in 2018, where he studied the applicability of evolutionary
algorithms at automatically generating unit test cases for object-oriented
software.  Prior to that, he completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at
the University of Porto (Portugal) under the supervision of Rui Abreu.</p>

<p>José aims to improve the productivity of software developers and testers.
José is interested in software engineering, in particular static and dynamic
program analysis, mining software repositories, and applied machine learning.
José is actively recruiting strong students at both the undergraduate and
graduate level.  If you are a motivated student who is keen to study software
engineering, software testing, programming languages, data mining, or related
topics as part of a Master/PhD program, then he would be interested to hear from
you.</p>
