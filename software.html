<h2>EvoSuite</h2>

<p>To find defects in software, one needs test cases that execute the software
systematically, and oracles that assess the correctness of the observed behavior
when running these test cases.  EvoSuite is a tool that automatically generates
test cases with assertions for classes written in Java code.  To achieve this,
EvoSuite applies a novel hybrid approach that generates and optimizes whole test
suites towards satisfying a coverage criterion.  For the produced test suites,
EvoSuite suggests possible oracles by adding small and effective sets of
assertions that concisely summarize the current behavior; these assertions allow
the developer to detect deviations from expected behavior, and to capture the
current behavior in order to protect against future defects breaking this
behaviour.<br/><br/>

<h3>Experimental Data</h3>

A key factor of studying Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) on automatic test
generation is the selection of classes under test.  As many open source classes,
for example contained in the
<a href="https://www.evosuite.org/experimental-data/sf110">SF110</a> corpus,
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2739480.2754696">are trivially simple</a>
and would not reveal differences between algorithms, a selection of non-trivial
classes has been proposed in the
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7840029">DynaMOSA</a> study.  This
is a corpus of 117 open-source Java projects and 346 classes, selected from four
different benchmarks.  The complexity of classes ranges from 14 statements and 2
branches to 16,624 statements and 7,938 branches.  The average number of
statements is 1,109, and the average number of branches is 259.

<h2>GZoltar</h2>

<p>GZoltar is a framework for automating the testing and debugging phases of the
software development life-cycle.  At the moment, the framework is provided as
an Ant and Maven plug-in and integrates seamlessly with JUnit tests.<br/>

The idea of automating this process started in 2005 as part of the PhD research
of Rui Abreu working with Arjan J.C. van Gemund (back then at the Delft
University of Technology).  Initially, the focus was to automate the debugging
phase, and the initial idea, published at TAIC-PART'07, was to generate
diagnosis candidates taking as input the coverage information for each test
case.  Later in 2010, there was the need to provide better visualization
reports, which lead to the first version of GZoltar (and was published at
TOPI'11, an ICSE'11 workshop).<br/><br/>
